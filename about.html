            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a dedicated and aspiring full-stack developer with a strong foundation in computer applications, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) at Bareilly College, Bareilly, affiliated with Rohilkhand University.

            making a difference &#127775;, no matter how small it might seem.</p>

            I’ve explored ancient ruins &#127963;, swum in crystal-clear waters &#127965;&#65039;,
            and gotten lost in bustling cities &#127750;.
            What excites me most is meeting people &#128107; from different cultures &#127760;
            and learning about their traditions &#129488;, languages &#128483;&#65039;, and cuisines &#127836;.</p>

        <h3>&#128366;Lifelong Learner</h3>
        <p>There’s a saying: “Never stop learning because life never stops teaching.”
            I take that to heart! &#128149; Whether it's a new language &#127817;, a skill &#127932;, or
            a piece of trivia, I’m always hungry for knowledge. My current obsessions are:
            Podcasts: I love podcasts about science &#128300;, history &#128218;, and self-improvement &#129504;.
            Books: Fiction &#128218;, biographies &#128105;&#8205;&#127981;, and thought-provoking non-fiction are my
            go-to genres.</p>
    </div>

            Writing a book &#128366;
            Traveling to at least 50 countries &#127758;

            &#128105;&#8205;&#128105;, and
            even strangers I meet along the way &#128724;. My circle may be small,
            but it’s full of love &#10084;&#65039;, laughter &#128514;, and mutual growth &#127793;.

    <div>
        <h3>&#127881;Quirky Things About Me</h3>
        <p>I laugh at my own jokes, even if no one else does.
            I talk to my plants &#127793; because I believe they listen. &#127807;
            I’m obsessed with organizing things to the last detail &#128203;,
            but somehow my room always ends up messy &#129335;&#8205;&#9794;&#65039;.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>&#127752;What Makes Me Happy</h3>

            A beautiful sunset &#127749;
            The smell of rain &#127783;
            A hot cup of coffee &#9749; in the morning
            Random acts of kindness &#128140; </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>&#129513;Challenges and How I Tackle Them</h3>
        <p>Life isn’t always sunshine &#9728;&#65039; and rainbows &#127752;, but I believe challenges
            are what make us grow&#127793;.
            When things get tough:
            1. I take a deep breath&#128104;&#8205;&#127807;.
            2. Focus on what I can control &#9989;.
            3. Ask for help when I need it &#128682;.
            4. Remind myself that it’s okay to fail and try again &#128170;.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>&#128640;Vision for the Future</h3>
        <p>I dream of a world where people live harmoniously &#127758;, and kindness is the norm &#127775;.
            I hope to play my part in creating that reality by inspiring positivity &#10024;
            and encouraging others
            to be their authentic selves &#127775;.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>&#128153; Why I’m Grateful</h3>
